# Dropbin

This application is a simplified version of the dropbox where different clients synchronize a set of files.
Each client will be linked to a dropbox server, it will find out which other clients are logged in and the 
information on how to communicates with them. Each client will be linked to each other client in order to
synchronize their files, so that they all have up-to-date copies of all files.

# Execution

./dropbox_server –p portNum

portNum: is the port number that the application is listening.


./dropbox_client –d dirName –p portNum –w workerThreads –b bufferSize –sp
serverPort –sip serverIP

- dirName: is the directory with the files that the client will share with other clients.

- portNum: is the port that the dropbox_client will listen to receive messages from the server and from
other customers.

- workerThreads: is the number of WorkerThread threads that the dropbox_client will create.
The threads can be created once at the beginning when the dropbox_client starts.

- bufferSize: is the size of the circular buffer that will be shared between the threads 
that are generated by the dropbox_client process.

- serverPort: is the port number where the dropbox_server is listening.

- serverIP: is the IP address of the dropbox_server to which the dropbox_client will connect.
